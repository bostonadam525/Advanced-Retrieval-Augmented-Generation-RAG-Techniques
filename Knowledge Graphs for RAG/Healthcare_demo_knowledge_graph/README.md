# healthcare demo knowledge graph
* This is a demo example of how to create a knowledge graph with some fake healthcare data.
* In this example we create a Knowledge graph using NEO4J cypher from a raw CSV file.
* We can then visualize the graph nodes-entities-relationships in NEO4J as well as query the graph using LangChain.


# Visualization of healthcare demo knowledge graph
* Below is the entire constructed graph.
