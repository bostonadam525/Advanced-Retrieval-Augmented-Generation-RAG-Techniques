# Graph DB with LangChain 

1. Knowlege Graphs 
  * Form the foundation of Graph DBs

2. Neo4j
  * One of many open source Graph DBs.
  * Uses Cypher query language. 
  * Uses Property Graphs
      * Property graphs store data as nodes connected by relationships.
      * Another example of Property Graph would be AWS Neptune. 

3. RAG Applications with Graph Databases using Neo4j
  * LangGraph (via LangChain) is actually an example of a knowledge graph implementation. 
      * Multi-AI Agent network uses knowledge graph architecture/fundamental concepts.
