# Resource Description Framework (RDF) Graphs

---
## What is RDF?
* A way to make statements about things such as:
1. Documents
2. Physical Objects
3. People
4. Concepts
5. Data Objects

## What is an RDF Statement? 
* The RDF data model is built around "3 part statements" known as **Triples**.
* A set of RDF data is a set of triples.
* Each triple states that a certain resource, for a certain property, has a certain value.
* These three triple states are called:
  1. Subject (e.g. source being described)
  2. Predicate (e.g. relationship)
  3. Object (e.g. the thing related to the Subject)

* Multiple RDF statements are used to make up a **Knowledge Graph**.

## Advantages of RDF framework?
1. Consistent framework that encourages the sharing of metadata.
2. A standard syntax and query language capabilities to enable applications to exchange information more easily (e.g. interoperability)
3. Semantic search results are more precise as they are based on metadata.
4. Software agents have more semantic/meaningful data to work with and produce a more meaningful result. 


## Disadvantages of RDF Framework?
1. Standardized vocabulary for RDF resources/statements can often be difficult and time consuming.
2. Choosing the MOST appropriate syntax format takes practice, experience, and often many trials. 
3. Choosing the MOST appropriate query language really depends upon the needs of your application(s).
