        "2. Add text documents to the newly created collection with metadata and a unique ID - this allows indexing.\n",
        "   * When a collection receives text, it automatically converts it into an embedding.\n",
        "3. You can query collections by text or embeddings to receive semantically similar documents in return.\n",
