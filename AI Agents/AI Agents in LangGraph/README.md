# AI Agents in LangGraph


What is LangGraph

LangGraph library for building stateful multi-actor apps using LLMs.

Used to create agent and multi-agent workflows. 

In the LLM ecosystem it is very beneficial because it offers:
Cycles
Controllability 
Persistence

LangGraph allows us to define flows that involve cyles that are essential for most agentic architectures which differentiates it from DAG-based solutions. 
DAG is a Directed Acyclic Graph, a type of graph whose nodes are directionally related to each other and donâ€™t form a directional closed loop. In the practice of analytics engineering, DAGs are often used to visually represent the relationships between your data models.

A knowledge graph or graph database is a DAG, but LangGraph is a bit different.
